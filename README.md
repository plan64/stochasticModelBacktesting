# stochasticModelBacktesting
Educational code: Is a given stock price process compatible with a specified stochastic model?

Being an integral part of the development of financial market models and risk measurement, backtesting plays a key role in operations of major investment firms. A central component of the Basel III regulatory guidance of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs22.htm) is a summary of practices how to validate and test internal models.

This code illustrates a methodology for risk factor backtesting for educational purpose. It orients itself at [A Sound Basel III Compliant Framework for Backtesting Credit Exposure Models](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2264620).
